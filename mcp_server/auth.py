"""
auth.py — Session-based authentication for the Copperleaf Kitchens MCP server.

Design decision (see README "Deliberate Scope & Design Decisions"):
No tool accepts staff identity as an argument. A model, or an injected
prompt, could simply assert any identity it wanted if identity were a plain
parameter. Instead, the CLIENT authenticates once when a session starts
(with staff.api_token), and every tool handler resolves identity/role from
that already-authenticated session — never from anything the model typed.

This module only answers one question: given a token, who is calling, and
are they allowed to be here at all (active account)? It knows nothing about
which tools exist or what a given tool requires — that's handler-level
authorization, done in server.py, on top of this.

TODO before the Streamable HTTP transport transition: this is currently
called ONCE per connection (stdio: one process = one client). A single
process under Streamable HTTP can serve MULTIPLE staff concurrently — do
not keep a single module-level SESSION global once that transition happens.
resolve_staff() must be called per-request at that point (e.g. from a
per-request Authorization header), not once at process startup.
