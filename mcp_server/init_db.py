"""
init_db.py — Builds copperleaf.db from schema.sql + seed.sql.

Run once before starting the server (or any time you want a clean reset):
    python mcp_server/init_db.py

This is intentionally separate from db.py: db.py only ever OPENS the
database and expects it to already exist. Nothing in the server itself
creates or seeds tables — that's a deliberate separation, so "how does the
demo data get there" is one obvious file, not folded into server startup.
