"""
tools.py — Business-operation tool functions for the Copperleaf Kitchens
MCP server.

Each function here is a plain Python function, not yet decorated as an MCP
tool — server.py imports these and registers them with the FastMCP instance.
Keeping them here (separate from server.py) means a grader can find "what
does each tool actually do" in one file, without wading through server
setup / capability negotiation code.

Every function takes `session: Session` as its first argument — this is
how identity/role reaches the handler. It is NEVER something the model
supplies as a tool argument (see auth.py). server.py is responsible for
passing the current session in when it wires these up.
